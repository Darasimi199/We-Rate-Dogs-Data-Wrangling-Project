# We-Rate-Dogs-Data-Wrangling-Project
This project is the second project in the Udacity Python for Data Analysis Nanodegree.
The goal of this project is to get hands on experience of data wrangling i.e data gathering, assessing and cleaning.

The dataset that was wrangled (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, 
also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. 
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. 
Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.

Three different datasets from different sources and formats were worked with, read into dataframes, assessed, cleaned and merged into 
one master dataset that was then used for analyses and insights.

The first dataset was the 'we_rate_dogs' twitter archive which was provided in a csv format that was downloaded manually.
The second dataset was a tsv file that contains the image prediction of each dog generated by a neural network, this file had to be downloaded programmatically.
The third dataset was queried into a JSON file from the twitter API.

After reading in all the datasets, they were assessed for quality and tidiness issues and were cleaned accordingly. 
They were merged into a master dataset and then was analyzed and insghts were drawn.
